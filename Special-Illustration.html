<p><b>Polly (Original)</b></p>
<img src="qvJyYxwP/130306-v6.jpg">
<p>My first drawing in chickenpaint! I made it on 2draw.net on September 22, 2022. Looking back on it over a year later, it's rather crummy, but it has a lot of sentimental value to me 〔´∇｀〕.</p>

<p><b>Two Little Sunflowers (Original)</b></p>
<img src="wTcD0GX5/130335-v20-1.jpg">
<p>Ah, another one of my old 2draw pics. By my current standards it's kinda bad, but I really liked it when I made it. Even now, I think it's rather sweet.</p>

<p><b>That McDonald's Vine But It's Teekyuu (fanart)</b></p>
  <img src="x1tqYHJ4/Teekyuu.jpg" alt="Teekyuu_Meme">
<p>I thought of this meme on a whim one day and decided to draw it. Teekyuu is a rather obscure work outside of Japan, I wish it would become more popular...</p>

<p><b>Friendship (Fanart)</b></p>
<img src="SKRRKscN/ezgif-5-70c2d12006.jpg">
<p>Yes, this is a fan illustration. It's based on a really obscure work, The Hill by Horace Annesley Vachell, which is a book, so I've had to use my imagination to some extent. It's too unknown to have a fandom, but I'm a creative person so I feel the impulse to create secondary creations even if only really for my own enjoyment.</p>
