    <p>Here you will find links to <em>free</em> resources for learning and improving anime and manga art skills. All books linked are hosted on the Internet Archive and are in Japanese or Chinese,  however the illustrations are clear and the information can be easily absorbed via visual cues. Most of the instructions in these books were designed around traditional work but are easily applicable to digital mediums.</p>
    <p>I created this page due to the sheer amount of high-quality anime drawing resources available online that few people seem to be taking advantage of, possibly because combing through hundreds of resuts on the Internet Archive takes time, or because most of the really good tutorials aren't in English or for whatever reason. In order to "git gud" at drawing you cannot just draw without reliable guides to learn from. There is plenty of art advice available online for free, but art instruction online is one of those areas where the rule of, "90% of anything is trash" applies.</p> 
    <h2>Character Drawing Resources</h2>
    <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/manga_draw_quyty2013_0159/mode/2up">日本大师讲漫画基础篇Let's Draw Manga回林晃著赤丁香译</a> - Rìběn dàshī jiǎng mànhuà jīchǔ piān Let's Draw Manga huí lín huǎngzhe chì dīngxiāng yì, or Japanese Masters Speaking Manga Let's Draw Manga Basics.

Another Chinese book but I'm unsure whether or not this one had a Japanese edition. Anyway, another book on drawing female characters, except this one is more varied and is focused more on Beautiful girls than cute ones, although the examples contain plenty of both! Jokes aside, contains instruction and lots of pictures  regarding anatomy & proportions, poses, hair, and stylizing. I personally like the style used in this one.</p>
    <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/howtodraw_202105/HDM%20Vol.%2021%20Bishoujo%20Pretty%20Gals/page/19/mode/2up">卡通漫画绘画技法 美少女的画法</a> - Kǎtōng mànhuà huìhuà jìfǎ měi shàonǚ de huà fǎ, or  Cartoon Manga Drawing Techniques Drawing Techniques of Beautiful Girls.

This book is a fairly comprehensive guide on drawing female characters with moe characteristics. Focuses mainly on faces, expressions, anatomy, and dressing characters in typical moe outfits like lolita dresses and sailor fukus. Recommended for those with an interest moe and kawaii aesthetics. There are also a few other books in this same series, <a href="https://archive.org/details/no.01.r">コミックス ドロウイングブック ( No. 01) 萌えスタイルの描き方</a>, this one focuses more on poses as well as having a section about digital coloring, and <a href="https://archive.org/details/aka5.r">萌えキャラクタ の描き方 (コスチュ ム編）</a> this one focuses more on clothes.</p>

This one is about techniques mostly used in shojo manga and includes plenty of illustrations that I believe were drawn by mangaka Arina Tanemura. Good for learning about utilizing aesthetic choices common in shojo manga.</p>

A Japanese book from, you guessed it, 2009 that features several different artists and features detailed guides on drawing clothing for female characters. Pretty long and is one of the better clothing guide books in my opinion. </p>

Similar to the last one in that it's mainly about drawing pretty boys but this one has sections on referencing from real photos, as well as more on composition. Comprehensive anatomy section and includes character design tips. It was published  more recently than the last book (2013) and is more aesthetically relevant as far as style goes (this is just a preference).</p>

    <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/toshitheultimatehzlib.org/mode/2up">The Ultimate Guide To Character Drawing: Presented by toshi</a> - An extensive guide to character drawing with a lot of focus on referencing from photographs and achieving natural poses and movement. Markedly different from several of the other books listed here in that the examples are drawn in a relatively more realistic style. I came across two other books by this author, <a href="https://archive.org/details/illustration-improvement-technique_20210624_0508">this one</a> and <a href="https://archive.org/details/professional-skills-learned-from-scratch"> this one</a>. Both focus on common errors and how to fix them and techniques to help improve fundamentals.</p>
    <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/r_20190728/mode/2up">人体解剖図から学ぶキャラクターデッサンの描き方</a> - Jintai kaibō-zu kara manabu kyarakutādessan no kakikata or, How to draw character sketches based on human anatomy.

    <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/1.r_20190728">ころもゆうぎ<a>- Koromo Yuugi, or in English, Clothing Play. A Japanese book depicting anime girls putting on various common anime/manga outfits like a shrine maiden outfit and a cheerleader uniform. No actual tutorials/step by step but good for reference to figure out how to depict fabric folds and texture. Shouldn't be used by itself in my opinion. The illustrations are very cute and are in full color. </p>
    <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/20190728_20190728_0617">おんなのこの髪型カタログ</a> - Onnanoko no Kamigata Catalog, or Girl's Hairstyle  Catalog. Another reference book now depicting common anime girl hair styles. Like Koromo Yuugi it lacks step-by-step walk throughs but it does hi-light different hair shapes and the way hair sits on the head. A good supplementary book specifically for hair.</p>
    <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/r_20190728_201907">戦う！　和風武器イラストポーズ集</a> - Tatakau! Wafu Buki Illustration Pose Shu, or Fight! Japanese-Style Weapon Illustration Pose Collection (man that was a mouthful). A guide on drawing Fighting poses and weapons, as well as traditional Japanese style clothing with in depth examples. Recommended as a supplement for those interested in learning about drawing action oriented art, ninjas, samurai, that kind of thing.</p>
  <h2>YouTube Channels</h2>
  <p>I tend to be rather wary when it comes to YouTube channels for art tutorials and advice, as many art channels give objectively bad advice, use click bait-y titles and thumbnails, and the information isn't very easy to absorb due to many tutorial videos being bloated with unnecessary commentary, in my opinion. I have,  however found <a href="https://youtube.com/@hidechannel2">Hide Channel's</a> tutorials to be well explained. The audio is in Japanese but subtitles in several languages including English are available.</p>

  <p><a href="https://youtube.com/@mangamaterialsyoutube9454">Manga Materials</a> - Focuses mainly on anatomy but has tutorials on some other things
  like perspective too. A good resource for learning to apply realistic anatomy to anime art. Japanese narration with English subtitles.</p>

  <H2>Non character drawing related resources</h2>
  <p>This following section is dedicated to resources covering things like backgrounds, animals, and coloring.</p>
  <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/how-to-draw-background-for-characters/mode/2up">背景画の 描き方</a> - Haikei-ga no kakikata or, How to Draw a Background Image. A Japanese book about drawing backgrounds digitally with a heavy focus on rendering. Although some of the information relating to perspective can be adapted to traditional art too. I think that this is mainly intended to be a guide on how to draw Visual Novel style backgrounds so if you're going for a different style, say a painterly style, YMMV.</p>
  <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/by-kazunori-ozawa/mode/1up">Animation Effect Drawing Technique</a> - Guide to drawing common atmospheric effects commonly seen in anime at various stages in movement.</p> 
  <h2>Useful non-manga style resources</h2>
  <p>Below are contained tried and true books not focused on ACG styled art that will nevertheless help you improve in fundamentals that are necessary to create good anime style illustrations. These are in English.</p>
  <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/Andrew_Loomis_Figure_Drawing_for_All_Its_Worth">Figure Drawing For All It's Worth</a> - A classic when it comes to figure drawing, you should atleast check this book out. Despite being written over half a century ago the fundamentals are still applicable.</p>
  <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/George_B_Bridgman_Constructive_Anatomy/mode/1up">Constructive Anatomy by George B. Bridgman</a> - Book that focuses on learning anatomy from studying the parts and their construction and then learning to put them together (as opposed to learning how to draw the whole body from life straightaway).
  <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/PerspectiveMadeEasy/mode/1up">Perspective Made Easy</a> - Being one of the most commended books on perspective and trusted for decades, Perspective Made Easy contains valuable information on one of art's fundamental concepts presented in an easy to understand manner.</p>
